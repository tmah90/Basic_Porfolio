            Currently a student at Columbia University's coding boot camp, and graduate of Stony Brook University with a BS in Health Care Informatics.
            My motto in life is "Opportunities are for people who are prepared for them". During the day,I work as an EHR trainer for Northwell and a 
            part time DJ at night.  
           I have a one year old maltipoo puppy who is a crybaby and whines all the time. He is a picky eater and waste my money but refusing 
           to eat kibbles. He has a round patch of black fur on his lower back and a one black eye which makes him unique. Please follow him on instagram
